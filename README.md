# Ok Systems

This repo is created for my business [OK Systems](https://www.oksystems.com.au/). It is planed to deliver by the end of this Month (31 June), and I create this to keep some thought.

## Stacks

- Gatsby
- React
- Styled Component
- GraphQL
- Netlify


## Challenges

- Gatsby and GraphQL are pretty new to me, needs several days to learn.
- Last time I use styled component was 2 years ago, needs read the docs again.
- Consider SEO, performance comes first.
- Potential CI/CD

## Why I do this way ?

When it comes to business, more exposure always be one of the critical considerations, thus SEO is vital. **CSR** definately is not a good way, **SSR** could be, but **JAMstack** is the best choice, as I don't need update this site frequently, probably will not use any API (sorry I forgot that updating content is also a way of doing SEO). But for now, static site should be enough, even future I can setup CI/CD for this.
Netlify is free for hosting, just do it.

## Ideas

So now I have figured out what to use and why, the next question would be how to use it, I may start the beginner project, and modify it with my content.
And a few wireframes may be needed, design the layout and how I structure the components.
